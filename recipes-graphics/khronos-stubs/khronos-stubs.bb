SUMMARY          = "Stub libraries for EGL / OpenGL ES / Vulkan"
DESCRIPTION      = "Generates stub libraries from the official khronos header files. \
The libraries themselves do nothing, but allow code to link against them \
and therefore can be used for building native code. \
It is expected that at runtime these libraries are swapped out with vendor \
supplied versions. \
