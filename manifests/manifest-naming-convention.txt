Naming convention within this "manifests" dir of this git repository

1)Directories within "manifests" dir
---------------------------------------
app/
app-restricted/
base/
runtime/
sdk-oss
sdk-tools

2)Naming and dir convention within manifests/app dir
---------------------------------------
manifests/app/companyname/appname.dev.xml 
manifests/app/companyname/rel/appname.rx.y.z.xml 
  
  [/companyname/]  per company releasing/maintaining such appname.
  [appname.dev.xml] for manifest file name that contains dev branch of  meta-bolt-app-appname-company associated with the app.
  [/companyname/rel/appname.rx.y.z.xml] for release versions of app, manifest file name contains the associated version as extension in name 
  [appname.rx.y.z.xml] for manifest file name with version extension in name for release app manifests, 
      those manifests need to be fixed revision manifests that always allow the exact same  version of the app to be  rebuild/replicated from sources in that manifest
  
Example:  
manifests/app/rdkm/appname.dev.xml 
manifests/app/rdkm/rel/bolt-examples.r1.0.0.xml

manifests/app-restricted/ is for apps that have manifests that points to repositories that are not open source, require specific access rights


3)Naming convention within /base dir
---------------------------------------
manifests/base/base.dev.xml
manifests/base/rel/


4)Naming and dir convention within /runtime dir
---------------------------------------
/runtime/runtimename/runtimename.companyname.dev.xml     
/runtime/runtimename/rel/runtimename.companyname.rx.y.z.xml   
  [runtimename.companyname.dev.xmll] this manifest file name that contains dev branch of  meta-rdke-app-appname-company associated with this runtime
  [rel/runtimename.companyname.rx.y.z.xml] for release version of runtime, manifest file name contains the associated version as extension in name 
      those manifests need to be fixed revision manifests that always allow the exact same  version of the runtime to be rebuild/replicated from sources in that manifest

Example:

runtime/wpe/wpe238.rdkm.dev.xml
runtime/wpe/wpe238.comcast.dev.xml 
runtime/wpe/wpe246.igalia.dev.xml
runtime/wpe/rel/wpe238.rdkm.r4.1.xml

runtime/cobalt/cobalt25.rdkm.dev.xml
runtime/cobalt/rel/cobalt25.rdkm.r1.0.xml

5)Proposed meta-layer names: TODO still to be agreed

meta-bolt-base   for baselayer

meta-bolt-run-runtimename-company     for a runtime
 meta-bolt-run-wpe             for default common WPE browser runtime maintained by RDK-M
 meta-bolt-run-wpe-companyA    CompanyA needs its own merge rights/layer to maintaing and/or sharing its slightly different flavor of WPE browser (eg for production reaons or for staying ahead wih upstream)
